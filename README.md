## Abstract
This thesis is dedicated to optimizing the performance of a web application through targeted measures in the areas of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, asset optimization and content rendering. In a comprehensive approach, various optimization techniques are considered and analyzed in two series of experiments for their effects on loading time and user experience.

The aim of this research is to find out which specific changes in the implementation and structuring of web components have the greatest impact on overall performance. The thesis presents a clear experimental design and twelve hypotheses, some of which are confirmed and others refuted.

Throughout the thesis, various metrics, particularly from Big-Rig and the Web Vitals, are used to analyze website performance. This research will not only shed light on the technical aspects of optimization, but also derive concrete recommendations for practical implementation.
